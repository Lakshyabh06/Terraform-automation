# Terraform-automation
This project is a basic Terraform setup to launch an AWS EC2 instance and install **Nginx** automatically using a shell script.

I created this project to understand how Infrastructure as Code works and how server setup can be automated.


## What it does
- Creates and EC2 instance using Terraform
- Installs and start Nginx during instance creation
- Deploy a simple HTML page automatically
- The Nginx app is accessible using **EC2-PUBLIC-IP**


## Files used
- Terraform automation files 
- Script for Nginx installation


## Output
Open the EC2-PUBLIC_IP in a browser
